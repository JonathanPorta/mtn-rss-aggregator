BANNACK - Wednesday afternoon's flash floods took a toll on the state's first territorial Capitol of Bannack
The water and mud destroyed at least one building, damaged others, and left roads in the park covered with debris
Bannack Days living history coordinator Stan Smith says due to the storm damage, Bannack State Park has been closed
Smith says this weekend's annual Bannack Days Celebration has been cancelled
Smith says the heavy rain and flooding hit around 3-30 Wednesday afternoon sending a torrent of water down Bannack's main street
"(It) caused flash flooding to go down the canyon," said Smith
 "Took out the Mercantile Building
 That's completely gone
"Smith also said the entire boardwalk along the road has been washed out
He said the amount of damage is unknown at this time and officials will be checking out the area tomorrow
 He expects it will be weeks before the park can be opened again
